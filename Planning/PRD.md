# Mealio – PRD

## Overview
A meal planning tool for individuals and families to easily manage their weekly food needs—from deciding what to eat, to buying groceries, to cooking meals. The app reduces the cognitive load of grocery shopping and meal planning, helping people feel more in control of what they eat without being overwhelmed.

This is a mobile-first product, but should be web accessible too.

## Problem Statement
Buying food and cooking regularly is a burden. Many people want to be healthy and plan meals but fall behind due to lack of tools to organize recipes, plan meals around their schedule, and shop efficiently. This leads to decision fatigue, wasted groceries, and last-minute takeout.

## Users
- Adults or families who cook at home 3+ times a week and want to eat healthier or reduce friction around food.

## Key Features

### 1. Recipe Supply
- **Recipe Ingestion (P0)**: Users can paste recipe URLs; app scrapes any website using metadata or parsing techniques to extract ingredients and instructions. Also supports manual entry.
- **Recipe Recommendations (P2)**: Suggests recipes based on user preferences and pantry gaps.
- **Recipe Usage History (P1)**: Tracks how often you use recipes and which you’ve liked for smarter future planning.

### 2. Meal Planning
- **Queue Recipes (P0)**: Add recipes from your bank to a planning queue.
- **Auto-Generate Grocery List (P0)**: Aggregates all ingredients from planned meals into a master shopping list.
- **Weekly Planning Nudges (P1)**: App prompts you weekly to plan meals.
- **Calendar Availability Insight (P1)**: Reads your calendar to estimate how many meals you might want to plan for, without assigning them to specific days or times.
- **Recipe Suggestions (P1)**: Suggest meals based on your bank. Possibly “Tinder”-style swipe interface for accepting/rejecting suggestions.

### 3. Shopping
- **Smart Shopping List (P0)**: Generates a categorized list with checkboxes for in-store use.
- **Instacart Export (P0)**: Bulk export shopping list into Instacart or other grocery apps.
- **Select All/None (P0)**: Easy toggling for editing and copying list content.

### 4. Cooking
- **Cooking Queue (P0)**: Shows only the meals you’ve planned for the week.
- **Cooking Mode (P0)**: Displays recipe instructions alongside ingredient amounts in-line for ease of use.
- **Clear After Cooking (P0)**: Marks recipe as done and removes from queue.

### 5. Households
- Households get created once a user invites another user.
- Recipe books show all of the recipes that belong to all users currently in a household, read and write access for all.
- When a user leaves a household, they keep write access to all of their recipes. In addition, they keep read access to all recipes that were in the household. The household also keeps read access to all recipes that it had access to when user was in the household. 
- When the user who left makes a new recipe, it's not accessible by the old household. Vice versa, when someone in the household makes a new recipe, it's not accessible for that user that left.
- When the user who left joins a new household, any of the recipes in their recipe book are accessible by that new household. Therefore, it's plausible that a single recipe can be accessible by multiple households. In fact this is a good pattern for a future of publishing and sharing recipes that can be added to recipe books
- If someone wants to edit a recipe that is now read only for reasons above, they can make a duplicate copy of it, which copies the recipe and removes their tie to the original recipe.

## Prioritization

**P0 – Core MVP**
- Recipe ingestion (scraper/manual)
- Recipe usage tracking
- Meal planning flow (recipe queue, grocery list, weekly planning nudges)
- Smart shopping list with select all/none
- Cooking queue and cooking mode with in-line quantities

**P1 – Automations/Integrations**
- Calendar integration (read-only availability insight)
- Recipe suggestions (swipeable recommendations)
- Instacart export
- Grocery list organization (e.g., grouping by aisle/type)

**P2 – Generative Enhancements**
- Recipe generation based on preferences or pantry gaps
- Advanced recipe recommendations using AI

## Open Questions
- Should users be able to track pantry items or inventory?
- Will recipes have tagging or dietary filters?
- What platforms are we targeting first—web, iOS, both?
- What third-party APIs exist for categorizing or organizing food items by type or grocery aisle?

Next Steps:
- Define onboarding experience
- Identify third-party APIs (e.g., recipe parsers, grocery categorization, calendar access)
- Start with a simple weekly planning loop

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
We will follow a **shared‑core, separate‑shells** approach so the same business logic powers all platforms while each surface gets a layout that feels native:
- **Architecture**: Monorepo using Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- **Mobile (iOS & Android)**: React Native (Expo) in `/apps/mobile`
  - Navigation: React Navigation (stack & tab)
- **Web**: React (Next.js) in `/apps/web`
  - PWA‑enabled build for desktop & mobile browsers
- **Shared Packages**:
  - `@mealio/core` – domain models, business logic, hooks
  - `@mealio/ui` – cross‑platform design‑system primitives
  - `@mealio/adapters` – thin wrappers for device capabilities (camera, notifications, file picker)
- **State Management**: Zustand (or React Context) defined in `@mealio/core`


### Backend
- **Platform**: Node.js + Express (or Fastify) for REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase or hosted on Railway
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth or Clerk
- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify (frontend), Railway or Fly.io (backend)

### Recipe Ingestion
- **Approach**: Scrape recipe content from any URL using open-source tools or metadata parsing.
- **Ingredient Parsing**: We will use [`sharp-recipe-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp-recipe-parser) to extract and structure ingredient data from recipe instructions.
  - Pros: Free, open-source, supports unit conversion, TypeScript support.
  - Responsibility: Parsed results will be normalized and stored with recipe metadata in the backend.

### Grocery Categorization
- Explore use of third-party tools like Supermarket API or AI-based classification methods (e.g. regex, embeddings) for mapping ingredients to store aisles or categories.

### Notifications
- For planning nudges (P1), we'll investigate browser push support (Web Push API) and its limitations on mobile Safari/Chrome.
